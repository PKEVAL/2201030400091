        >Google has been investing in AI for many years and bringing its
        benefits to individuals, businesses and communities. Whether it’s
        publishing state-of-the-art research, building helpful products or
        developing tools and resources that enable others, we’re committed to
        making AI accessible to everyone. <br />
        <br />We’re now at a pivotal moment in our AI journey. Breakthroughs in
        generative AI are fundamentally changing how people interact with
        technology — and at Google, we’ve been responsibly developing large
        language models so we can safely bring them to our products. Today,
        we’re excited to share our early progress. Developers and businesses can
        now try new APIs and products that make it easy, safe and scalable to
        start building with Google’s best AI models through Google Cloud and a
        new prototyping environment called MakerSuite. And in Google Workspace,
        we’re introducing new features that help people harness the power of
        generative AI to create, connect and collaborate.</span

          in Google Workspace, whether it’s using Smart Compose in Gmail or
          auto-generated summaries in Google Docs. Now, we’re excited to take

          that makes the process of writing even easier. In Gmail and Google
          Docs, you can simply type in a topic you’d like to write about, and a
          draft will be instantly generated for you. So if you’re a manager
          onboarding a new employee, Workspace saves you the time and effort
          involved in writing that first welcome email. From there, you can
          elaborate upon or abbreviate the message or adjust the tone to be more
          playful or professional — all in just a few clicks. We’ll be rolling
          out these new experiences to testers in the coming weeks.</span
